Enemies:
Added enemy player models, they are just angry farmers for now. 
The red farmer that spawns is a bit bigger that the first farmer.

World:
Added a living room.
Kitchen is basically complete.
Added 3 rooms, 2 bedrooms are basically complete. 
3rd bedroom is in progress.
I'll be fixing the floors soon too.

Gameplay adjustments:
Fixed not being able to buy ammo.
Increased sprint speed.
Added boundaries to the map.

Bugs:
Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.

I will update the menus at a later time. 
I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
I will also try update the hitbox of the player so you don't randomly spin.
