Gameplay adjustments:
Ammo crates now disapear and randomly spawn around the map. 
Crosshair now correctly disappears when reloading.
Adjusting UI for a better look (in progress).

Bugs:
Reload sound plays when the game is paused. 

Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.

I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
