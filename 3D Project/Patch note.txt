WARNING CPU AND GPU USAGE IS REALLY HIGH - Will be investigating and working on fix.

Gameplay adjustments:
Fixed volume control for zombies. Works as intended now!
Adjusting UI for a better look (in progress).
Added Main Menu music.
Added a new look for the main menu.
Red farmer zombies now spawn from round 6.
The rounds are now continuous.
Ammo refill now has a 3D model rather than a yellow box.

Bugs:
Reload sound plays when the game is paused. 
Zombies occasionally dropping 2 coins instead of one.
Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.

I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
