CPU and GPU usage is fixed!!!

Gameplay adjustments:
Fixed a bug where zombies occasionally dropping 2 coins instead of one. The red farmer zombies only drop 2 coins, whereas the blue farmers drop 1.
Adjusting UI for a better look (in progress).

Bugs:
Reload sound plays when the game is paused. 

Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.

I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
