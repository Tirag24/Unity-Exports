Gameplay adjustments:
Reduced volume of zombie sounds, still working on audio slider for player to adjust.
Fixed a bug where the reload sound is cancelled when you press R to reload when you are already reloading.
Fixed a bug where the reload sound does not play when you run out of bullets.

Bugs:
Reload sound plays when the game is paused. 
Zombies occasionally dropping 2 coins instead of one.
Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.

I will update the menus at a later time. 
I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
