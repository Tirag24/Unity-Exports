Gameplay adjustments:
Added a roof for the house.
Installed ceiling lights around the house (some lights are off, and some flicker).
Fixed red enemies not making zombie sounds.
Adjusting UI for a better look (in progress).

Bugs:
Reload sound plays when the game is paused. 
Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.
I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
