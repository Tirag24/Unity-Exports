Gameplay adjustments:
Added gun shot sounds!
Improved reload sounds to play half correctly (see bugs below).

Bugs:
Reload sound plays when the game is paused. 
Reload sound does not play when you run out of bullets.
Reload sound is cancelled when you press R when you are already reloading. 
Zombies dropping 2 coins instead of one.

Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.

I will update the menus at a later time. 
I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
