Gameplay adjustments:
Added sound effects for collecting coins.
Hitmarker sounds now no longer cut out when you hit an enemy.
Adjusting UI for a better look (in progress).

Bugs:
Reload sound plays when the game is paused. 

Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.

I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
