Gameplay adjustments:
Added volume control for zombies! (only zombies for now)

Bugs:
Reload sound plays when the game is paused. 
Zombies occasionally dropping 2 coins instead of one.
Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.

I will update the menus at a later time. 
I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
