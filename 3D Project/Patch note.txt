Gameplay adjustments:
Fixed a bug where the player can go through walls.
Fixed a bug where the player randomly spins or turns inconsistently (I think).

Bugs:
Reload sound plays when the game is paused. 
Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.

I will update the menus at a later time. 
I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
