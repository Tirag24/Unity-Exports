World:
Updated colour scheme of the house.
Changed sized of props and doors.
Updated the floors.

Gameplay adjustments:
Removed the player model
Updated player hitbox, it's better than before. (Still working on it.)

Bugs:
Fixed not being able to reload gun after you buy ammo. 
Known issue with having a different jump height each time you start the game.

I will update the menus at a later time. 
I will also update the gun as it's not consistent with the games graphics.
